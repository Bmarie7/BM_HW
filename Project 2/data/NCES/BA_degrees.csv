The figures for earlier years have been reclassified when necessary to make them conform to the new taxonomy. To facilitate trend comparisons, certain aggregations have been made of the degree fields as reported in the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS): ""Agriculture and natural resources"" includes Agriculture, agriculture operations, and related sciences and Natural resources and conservation; ""Business"" includes Business, management, marketing, and related support services and Personal and culinary services; and ""Engineering technologies"" includes Engineering technologies and engineering-related fields, Construction trades, and Mechanic and repair technologies/technicians. Some data have been revised from previously published figures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
